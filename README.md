# GOAL:
In Class 23, you learned how to create boxes using classes, and drop them so they get stacked on top of each other.

In this project, you will have to practice and apply what you have learned in the class and add a simple feature on our Project 22 of Supply Mission. We will be dropping supplies and medical kits inside a designated red drop zone in the middle of a zombie apocalypse.

# STORY:
You are a sergeant on a military peacekeeping mission. Your task is to drop a package in a designated red drop zone. The package contains mission-critical items and is very important to be delivered at the exact location for the success of the mission.

Everyone before you has failed to finish the task. The success of the mission now depends on you.
